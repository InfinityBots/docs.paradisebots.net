title: Webhooks
---

Instead of requesting our API to see the users who have voted for your bot, we now have webhooks! Webhooks will send a POST request to a URL of your choice when your bot has been voted for.

---

## Getting Started
* Start setting up your webhook requests by following these steps:
1. Generate a Webhook in a Discord Channel of your choice.
2. Go to your bots edit form found at: `https://paradisebots.net/bots/:BOTID/edit` 
3. enter the URL you want the webhook to be sent to in the "Webhooks URL" field,
4.  you're all set! If you need help setting up webhooks inside of your bot don't be afraid to ask in our discord servers `#api-support` channel.
